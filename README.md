# Happy Teams

I want to build Happy Teams, and be part of Happy Teams. 

How can I do that? Is there a formula?

Having worked with a number of Startups in the last couple of years,
I have experienced and seen first-hand how practices (or lack of) can affect the emotional well-being of a Team.

In the spirit of the Joel Spolsky's Test, 
I thus came up with my own highly-opinionated checklist for building Happy Teams,
which shall also serve as guiding principles for my own Team in the future.

Think about it. What makes you happy/unhappy in your current Team?
I would love to get Pull Requests for suggestions on what you believe would make a Happy Team.

You might want to use this checklist:

- To review your current company's practices
- As a benchmark for the next company that you want to join

## The Checklist
